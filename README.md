# Website-pages

Files from my webpage (not all may be in use)

* Circle: Based on the 'mandelbrot lovehearts' by Coding Train in JS. Number of points the circle is divided into can be changed by scrolling.
* DVD: Based on the DVD bouncing logo screen by Coding Train. Image of the 'DVD' changes on contact with the corner.
* Entrance: entrance page to a jeff bezos themed website, just playing around with CSS animations and transition triggers.
